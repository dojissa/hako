Modular Planner

I built hako because every planner I tried was either too rigid or too complex. I wanted something modular that fits different needs — drag the panels you need, hide the ones you don't, and make it feel like yours.

It's made and maintained by one person. If it helps you, the premium version keeps it going. Feedback always welcome.
